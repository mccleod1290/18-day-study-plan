# Notes for day 2
23/11/23 Day-02

Discussed importance of soft skills
● Written ● Oral 

There are a lot of blogs on the internet, but this one nailed down the essence of soft skills. That too it deep dives on professional communication, some common pitfalls, and tips for better and effective communication and example. Best part is that they show an sample email and highlight the missing points, and they share what's lacking so that we don't do the same mistakes while communicating effectively, and for those who are feeling this is an area where we lack, the blog ends with an positive note that this is indeed a learnable skill.

And here comes the importance of written and oral skills, `written skills` are so important for `pentesters` because we will be disclose our `findings` to company executives, and stakeholders. There is saying that a good pentester may not have elite hacking skills but is certainly a good report writer. We are doing injustice to the company by not delivering good and quality report.

Deep dives into pentest report, and 'explains' why xyz should be in a report and why it should not be in report. This and the later talk strictly reject pasting from reports even if it's indirect and one should always avoid boiler templates when it comes to pentest reports. A good report is easy to understand, but a great report is hard to mis-understand, some words of wisdom from `bb king`.

In this talk `Bronwen Aker` outlines 7 deadly sins of bad presentation, but the most notable ones not writing good report[which can be fixed by taking classes on writing be it a professional, formal or writing in any form, taking toastmaster classes, writing blogs and using plugins like grammerly with caution], making proper screenshots, syntax highlights and appealing report with consistent formatting. Critically thinking from all view points does indeed improve the report a lot.
